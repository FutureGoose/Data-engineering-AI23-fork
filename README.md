# Data Engineering AI23
Welcome to the Data Engineering course for 2024! The aim of this course is to learn various data engineering concepts both theoretically and through implementations using various technologies. Data engineering is a very important are which covers the engineering aspects of data with focus on ingesting data into a data pipeline and transforming it in a consumable state for downstream use. Efforts in data engineering allows for roles such as data scientists, data analysts and business intelligence to not worry about where to find data and how to transform it, but instead work in their respective specialist domains.

This course builds upon previous skills in:

- pandas, numpy, SQL
- data visualisation tools: matplotlib, seaborn and plotly
- git and github

This course repo contains all lecture codes, lecture slides and exercises.

## Schedule
The schedule is divided into two parts: pre-summer and post-summer, where the first part focuses heavily on theory and core knowledge and the second part you will use what you've learnt to apply in a realistic project.
